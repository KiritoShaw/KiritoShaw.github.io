<p><strong>*Expat</strong> executives* were barred from returning to their business in China.</p>
<p>Inside the country, the virus is raging. Tens of millions of people are catching it every day. Hospitals are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The party is <em>banking on</em> it. It hopes to be judged not on the tragedy its incompetence is compounding, but on the economic recovery to follow.</p>
<p>Now <strong>would-be</strong> travelers are <strong>flocking</strong> to travel websites.</p>
<p>Economists are <em>penciling in</em> a GDP boost for Hong Kong of as much as 8% over time.</p>
<p>Take the oil market. Rising Chinese demand should more than compensate for <strong>faltering</strong> consumption in Europe and America, as their economies slow.</p>
<p>A rapid recovery in China could help push the price of Brent crude oil to $100 a barrel, an increase of a quarter compared with today’s prices. Rising energy costs will prove another hurdle to <em>taming inflation</em>.</p>
<p>For China itself, the post-pandemic normal will not be a return to the <em>status quo ante</em>.</p>
<p>China’s previous great reopening led to an explosion of prosperity as goods, people, investment and ideas surged across its border in both directions.</p>

This year may be almost as bad</p>
<ul>
<li>rout, bloodbath, nudge</li>
<li>race for the exit [争相退场]</li>
<li>fall into recession</li>
<li>bullish <strong>lot</strong></li>
<li>during the bursting of the <em>dotcom bubble</em> [互联网泡沫]</li>
<li>on account of</li>
<li>book asset</li>
<li>during each of the two years <strong>preceding</strong> the covid-19 pandemic</li>
</ul>
<p>After a <strong>nightmarish</strong> 2022, <strong>shell-shocked</strong> investors have losses to <strong>recoup</strong> and plenty to <strong>ponder</strong>.</p>
<p>Economically, there is a clear answer: this year will be grim.</p>
<p>In theory, markets are forward-looking, and fears of recession <strong>stalked</strong> the world for much of 2022. Such a <em>widely-held consensus</em> should be <u>baked into</u> today’s prices, meaning even a marginally better outlook would <strong>buoy</strong> prices.</p>
<p>Stock prices mostly go up. They rarely decline two years <em>in a row</em>.</p>
<p>Despite last year’s plunge, the price-to-earnings ratio for “growth” stocks, those of companies <em>promising big future profits</em>, has fallen back only to where it was in 2019.</p>
<p>But as recession <em>sets in,</em> both types are vulnerable to earnings, downgrades that are, for the most part, yet to materialise.</p>
<p>Central banks <em>pumped</em> endless <em>liquidity into the market</em> via quantitative easing (QE).</p>
<p>Even without central banks raising short-term interest rates, this <strong>glut</strong> could drive bond prices down and yields up.</p>

<p>The monetary guardians do not <em>have the heart to</em> <strong>inflict</strong> the pain it would take to get it down.</p>
