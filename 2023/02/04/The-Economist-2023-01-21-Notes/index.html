<p>Technology is turning the business of culture upside down</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of what is written about marketing to today’s most prized consumers is a myth. </p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the idea that, glued to smartphones, Gen Z barely notices the physical worlds and slavishly follows the latest hype from Instagram or TikTok. It is true that the days of marketing chiefly through television, newspapers and magazines are long gone. Yet social media has not just changed the ways in which people discover brands; it has undermined the power of marketing as a whole. </li>
<li>There is similar temptation to think that physical shops no longer matter. But what works best is the seamless combination of the digital (virtual) and physical worlds. </li>
<li>Don’t assume that all young customers are DiAngelo reading social warriors. Most consider a brand’s sustainability  and social impact before checkout.</li>
<li>What really matters is avoiding hypocrisy. Avoid platitudes, commit only to causes you can tangibly support and be frank when you are putting profits first. </li>

<p>A myth-busting memo on how to sell to the young</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upheaval rocking the Walt Disney Company today has relevant far beyond its empire. Disney’s trial are not just a boardroom drama. Similar crises are unfolding at other leading culture factories, from Warner Bros to Netflix. The reason is a technological revolution that is shaking things up again. Online distribution has enticed tech firms that make the hardware and software used for streaming. At the same time, new technology is allowing those lower down the “long tail” a better chance of reaching the profitable top. The first beneficiaries have been non-American film studios. Perhaps the most dramatic way technology could disrupt the culture business is by creating new categories of entertainment. Some Silicon Valley rivals are snapping up gaming IP. Movies based on games are becoming as popular as games based on movies. The great creative factories of Hollywood will have to adapt if they want to survive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the first time since the 1960s, Chinas population</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The news, released on January 17th, that the country’s population had fallen last year for the first time in decades swept Chinese social media. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China had 1.412bn people at the end of last year, 850,000 fewer than at the start. Despite an unnatural number of deaths caused by covid 19 virus, the reason for the decline is clear: a plummeting desire to reproduce. Now as China ageing rapidly, the government has tried desperately to remedy this, though far too late. The relaxation of one-child-per-couple policy — accompanied by a slew of incentives to have children, ranging from cash handouts to tax breaks and longer maternity leave — has had little impact. There are several reasons why baby-making is becoming less popular. The main one is the cost of rearing children. (Government handouts have done little to ease the burden on parents.) Another economic barrier to childbirth is the cost of looking after the elderly. The reluctant of some young Chinese to marry and reproduce is also a sign of how traditional values are changing.</p>

<p>Why pointing fingers is unhelpful, and why bosses do it more than anyone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Casting blame is natural, but also corrosive. Pointing fingers saps team cohesion. And firms whose managers pointed to external factors to explain their failings underperformed companies that blamed themselves. Some industries have long recognized the drawbacks of fault-finding. The incentive to learn from errors are similarly strong in health care as well, where lives are at risk. There is an obvious worry about embracing blamelessness. Sometimes, after all, blame is deserved. The idea of “just culture”, a framework developed in the 1990s, narrows room for blame but does not remove it entirely. There are two bigger problems with trying to move away from the tendency to blame. The first is that it requires a lot of effort. The second problem is the boss. A recent paper found that people who are in positions of authority are more likely to blame others for failures. Power and punitiveness went together. Researchers found that blame also seems to be contagious…</p>

<p>Three rival firms each hope to land the first private-sector probe on the Moon in the next few weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recent years launching things into orbit has become the province of private enterprise. When it comes to sending things to the Moon, however, governments retain a monopoly of success. All success lunar landers, orbiters and rovers have been launched at taxpayers’ expense. That seems likely to change in the next few weeks, when an uncrewed landers becomes the first commercial vehicle to touch down on the Moon. But which lander — or which company — will claim that accolade remains unclear. There is, in other words, a new Moon race. HAKUTO-R Mission 1 was launched on December 11th on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The “low energy” designation of trajectory takes longer to arrive at the Moon, but uses less fuel, than a direct trajectory. But its slower voyage also means that it could be overtaken by two other landers intended to arrive on the lunar surface before the date of its planned touchdown. The first of these is Nova-C, which chose a direct trajectory to minimize the radiation risk to the craft. The third contender is the Peregrine lander built by Astrobotic Technology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A flurry of new studies identifies causes of the Industrial Revolution</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The industrial revolution was the biggest transformation in economic history. For centuries scholars have sought to understand why this process occurred in Britain around 1750. Researchers are now testing theories by studying why similar parts of Britain industrialized at different rates. New papers have yields evidence for a few key factors: slave-owners’ capital, entrepreneurs who stood to benefit from investing, and short-ages of lower-skilled workers. </p>
<ul>
<li>Industrialization requires investment, which requires capital. </li>
<li>Investors still needs financial incentives to buy machines. </li>
<li>Another factor that has gained support is labour shortages, which spurred the adoption of labour-saving machines in wartime. </li>
</ul>
<p>Such important variables are hard to test statistically, but measuring even a few is a promising advance.</p>

<p>As it launches its <strong>centenary</strong> celebrations on January 27th, the Walt Disney Company has <em>sustained its appeal to</em> the young and young-at-heart. </p>
<p>Its intellectual property (IP) is turned into merchandise ranging from lunchboxes to lightsabers, and exploited in theme parks that are <em>churning out</em> healthy profits even as covid-19 <strong>lingers</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Similar crises are unfolding</em> at other leading culture factories, from Warner Bros to Netflix.</p>
<p>The continuing pre-eminence of a <strong>centenarian</strong> like Disney has confounded many predictions.</p>
<p>But those at the very top of the business have thrived. When anyone can watch anything, people <em>flock to</em> the best.</p>
<p>Those who have <strong>fared</strong> best at a shrinking <em>box office</em> are the owners of IP that is already popular.</p>
<p>Disney’s century has been one of endless reinvention, <em>in business terms</em> as well as artistic ones, as the company has moved its output from projectors to cables to cassettes and now bytes.</p>

<p>The trouble is that coming up with rules to define <em>a swathe of</em> humanity is more art than science.</p>
<p>Start with the idea that, <em>glued to</em> smartphones, Gen Z barely notices the physical world and <strong>slavishly</strong> follows the latest <strong>hype</strong> from Instagram or TikTok.</p>
<p>Surveys suggest that young Americans are among the most price-sensitive food shoppers.</p>
<p>There is a similar temptation to think that physical shops no longer matter. Young consumers love their Amazon deliveries. It makes sense for our company to make sales <em>via social media</em> and <em>ship directly to customers’ homes</em>. But what works best is the <strong>seamless</strong> combination of the digital and physical worlds.</p>
<p>It is chiefly youngsters who buy cheap <em>“fast-fashion” outfits</em> to wear once and then send to landfill.</p>

<p>It is yet another reminder that China no longer <em>enjoys the demographic dividend</em> of a huge supply of cheap labour to boost its growth.</p>
