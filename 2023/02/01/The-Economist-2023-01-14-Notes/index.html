<p>The world’s logistics giants are betting that the future of trade is more high-end — and more Asian</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tuas Mega Port, which sits on a swathe of largely reclaimed land at the western tip of Singapore, is a vision of future on two fronts. Across the planet, the expansion of seaports is becoming tougher, some of which was stopped on environmental grounds. One solution is to make existing logistics networks more efficient rather than merely larger. However, streamlining supply chains only gets you so far. At some point, new capacity will be needed. One way to achieve it is by reclaiming land from the sea. Many ports are too deep for land reclamation to be viable. Some are therefore deciding to build upwards. BoxBay’s “high-bay” storage system makes it practical compared to conventional set-ups. If you cannot build out or up, another option is to build elsewhere. That explains the rising popularity of island “dry ports”. All the dry-port development in Asia points to the second force reshaping the ports business: the shift of its center of gravity eastwards. Investments by shipping giants are pointing in the same eastward direction. This time, the future looks leaner, smarter — and more eastern.</p>

<p>Forget drug use and hammocks. Try tedium instead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a study published in 2022, three researchers tested the widespread notion that cannabis increases creativity. They found that cannabis increased users’ joviality, which is thought to encourage lateral thinking. But the problem is the independent assessors could discern no effect on the actual quality of people’s thoughts. You might think that doesn’t need saying. But the search for ways to unleash creativity seems to scramble executives’ brains. There is a rising interest in the use of psychedelics in the workplace, not simply as a health-care perk but also as a way of stimulating innovative thinking. </p>
<ul>
<li>Drugs is at the extreme end of a range of techniques whose purpose is to jolt people into a more innovative mind-set.</li>
<li>And there is near-universal obsession with turning bits of offices into playrooms. However, the effect of using an unconventional space to help stimulate innovative thoughts depends much on the task at hand.</li>
<li>Group activities undoubtedly have their place.</li>
<li>Tedium itself can be a useful spur to inspiration.</li>

<p>The dollar could bring investors a nasty surprise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today’s exchange rates are mostly floating, set by the market rather than at crunch talks. Yet a weaker dollar prompting signs of relief. A mighty greenback causes no end of problems. Poorer and rich countries alike can suffer. Unfortunately, the relief will be temporary. To see why, consider the sources of the dollar’s recent strength. One is the tightening monetary policy. A second source is fear of Russia-Ukraine conflict, China’s “zero-covid” policy and the teetering of the global economy towards recession. A final source is America’s economy — thanks in part to higher energy prices and the country’s status as an energy exporter. True, the pace of the Fed’s tightening is slowing, and its governors expect rates to peak this year. But they expect that peak to be higher than investors do and that it will be maintained longer than being cut. Even an American recession may not dent the dollar. Yet the best argument that the dollar will strengthen is investors’ conviction that it won’t. Nowadays, the greatest pain would come if the dollar were driven in the opposite direction. Investors could be in for a shock.</p>

<p>Proving a photo has been faked is one thing. Proving it hasn’t is quite another</p>
</blockquote>
<p>THE TRUTH is the first casualty of war is an old aphorism. The proliferation of images and videos of things that are outright fake in wars such as those currently going on in Ukraine and Syria, led to a second, more subtle approach to lying with images. Ways to establish the authenticity of digital imagery would therefore be valuable. </p>
<ul>
<li>One such system has been developed by eyeWitness, which at its core does two things. First, it deploys the technique of the controlled capture of metadata. Second, the app calculates an alphanumeric value  after reading the image’s entire sequence. All this done, it then puts the metadata and the hash into a file called a proof bundle and sends an encrypted copy of the image and the proof bundle to a special server, known as a digital evidence locker. If the calculated hash matches the original one in the server’s repository, then the image has not been retouched.</li>
<li>Nor is eyeWitness the only provider of glass-to-glass services. ProofMode, a smartphone app released by the Guardian Project, also combines controlled-capture metadata and the image’s hash into a proof bundle. Instead of operating the receiving server itself, though, ProofMode uses repositories run by other firms. Soon, the Guardian Project will add a new feature by linking an image’s location and time-of-caption to OpenStreetMap and a detailed record of the world’s weather.</li>
<li>A third operator, Truepic, of La Jolla, California, is taking a more commercial approach. Charities pay nothing to use its software, but some companies must stump up. </li>

<p>Antidepressants are over-prescribed, but genuinely help some patients</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around 10% western adults take antidepressants, making them one of the world’s most popular types of drugs.  A bias in scientific literature, on which doctors rely when deciding on treatment, is a potential explanation why  the drugs are prescribed so often. In 2022 the BMJ published a breakdown of all the relevant trials filed with the FDA in 1979-2016. It found that placebos replicated most of the pills’ benefits. Rather than a bell curve, the distribution of individuals’ results in the BMJ study looked like a plateau, with modest summit at one end. Two sets of results peaked on difference sides.</p>

<p>This brought about unprecedented economic integration that boosted growth, <em>lifted</em> hundreds of millions of people <em>out of poverty</em> and helped the West <strong>prevail</strong> over Soviet Russia in the cold war.</p>
<p>The old system was already <em>under strain</em>, as America’s interest in maintaining it <strong>waned</strong> after the global financial crisis of 2007-09.</p>
<p>And officials are banning the flow of ever more exports — notably of high-end chips and chipmaking equipment to China.</p>
<p>For many in Washington, muscular industrial policy holds a <strong>seductive</strong> appeal. It could help seal America’s <em>technological <strong>ascendancy</strong></em> over China, which has long pursued self-sufficiency in vital areas using state intervention.</p>
<p>The immediate consequence, however, has been to <em>set off</em> a dangerous <strong>spiral</strong> into protectionism worldwide.</p>
<p>Last year nearly a third of the <em>cross-border business deals</em> that came to the attention of European officials received detailed scrutiny.</p>
<p>Duplicating green supply chains will make it costlier for America and the world to <strong>wean</strong> themselves off carbon.</p>
<p>The task is enormous and urgent.</p>

<p>Driverless vehicles <strong>whizz</strong> across five new <strong>berth</strong> at Tuas Mega Port, which sits on <em>a swathe of</em> largely <em>reclaimed land</em> at the western <strong>tip</strong> of Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Unmanned</strong> crane loom overhead, circled by camera-<em>fitted</em> drones.</p>
<p>It illustrates how port operators the world over are <em>deploying clever technologies to</em> meet the demand for their services in the face of obstacles to the development of new facilities, from lack of space to environmental concerns. More fundamentally, the city-state’s investment, with construction costs estimated at $15bn, is part of a wave of huge bets by the broader logistics industry on the rising importance of Asia, and South-East Asia in particular.</p>
<p>Last year a big port expansion in Piraeus, Greece, was blocked by courts for failing to provide the right assessment of its environmental impact.</p>
<p>In April PSA finalised its purchase of BDP International, an American <strong>freight-forwarder</strong> specialising in supply-chain management, for <em>an undisclosed sum</em> (its previous private-equity owner had reportedly been looking for $15bn).</p>
<p><strong>Streamlining</strong> supply chains only gets you so far, however.</p>
<p>This requires <strong>feats</strong> of <em>civil engineering</em> — and is expensive.</p>
<p>Many ports are too deep for land reclamation to be viable.</p>
<p>In BoxBay’s “high-day” storage system, each container sits in an individual <strong>rack</strong>, where automated cranes can <strong>pluck</strong> them out individually.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s more than 70% of Asian exports <em>by value</em> went to other parts of the world.</p>

<p>Rather than a bell curve, the distribution of individuals’ results in the BMJ study looked like a plateau, with a modest summit at one end. For the drugs, this peak sat on the side representing large reductions in depression. For the <strong>placebo</strong>, it landed on the side of small declines.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>antidepressant</strong> is a drug which is used to treat people who are suffering from depression. 抗抑郁药</li>
<li>To <strong>inflict</strong> harm or damage <strong>on</strong> someone or something means to make them suffer it. 使遭受 (伤害或破坏等)</li>
<li>If something <strong>yields</strong> a result or piece of information, it produces it. 产生 (结果); 制造 (消息)</li>
<li>If someone <strong>touts</strong> something, they try to sell it or convince people that it is good. 兜售; 吹嘘 [表不满]</li>
<li>A <strong>breakdown</strong> <strong>of</strong> something is a list of its separate parts. 细目列表</li>
<li>If one thing <strong>obscures</strong> another, it prevents it from being seen or heard properly. 遮掩</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A situation or piece of information that is <strong>grim</strong> is unpleasant, depressing, and difficult to accept.</li>
<li>An amount or effect that is <strong>negligible</strong> is so small that it is not worth considering or worrying about.</li>
<li>If you <em>reap the benefits</em> or the rewards of something, you enjoy the good things that happen as a result of it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If you <strong>reconcile</strong> two beliefs, facts, or demands that seem to be opposed or completely different, you find a way in which they can both be true or both be successful. 使和谐一致; 调和</li>
<li>To <strong>underwhelm</strong> is to make no positive impact or impression on or disappoint 未给…留下好印象; 使…失望</li>
<li>A <strong>placebo</strong> is a substance with no chemical effects that a doctor gives to a patient instead of a drug. Placebos are used when testing new drugs or sometimes when a patient has imagined their illness. (无药用效果的)安慰剂</li>
