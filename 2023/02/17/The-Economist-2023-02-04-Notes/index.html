<p><strong>Big, green and mean</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden’s plan to remake the economy is ambitious, risky, confused and selfish — but it could help save the planet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the past two years Congress has passed three bills, on infrastructure, semiconductor chips and greenery, that will make $2trn available to reshape the economy. Mr Biden is acting on many fronts, because the only way to build a majority in Congress was to bolt a Democratic desire to act on climate change onto hawkish worries about the threat from China and the need to deal with left-behind places in the American heartland. On its own, each of these concerns is valid. But in terms of policy, the goals will sometimes conflicts with the necessity to bind these concerns together. A giant plan that has so many disparate objectives does not simply succeed or fail. Its full consequences may not become clear for many years. The administration has an answer for its critics (to develop new technologies, build supply chains that less independent on China and drive down the cost of clean sources of energy). America also has significant advantages: a rich internal market, vast landscapes for solar and wind farm, pipelines for transporting hydrogen and reservoirs in which to store carbon. Its universities and venture capital make it a hub for green innovation. The country is already sucking in foreign investment to work alongside the subsidies. And the policies enjoys a degree of political consensus. To help the plan realize its good intentions, three things needs to happen: First, the effort going into boosting domestic industry needs to be matched by a sustained program of trade diplomacy. Second, subsidies should tilt towards technologies that are not yet commercially viable. Third, to build a new subsidized infrastructure, America needs reform of its permit laws. For better or worse, Mr Biden’s blueprint for remaking the economy will change America profoundly.</p>

<p><strong>Latin American democracy | Dousing the fire</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peru is more divided and unstable than at any point since 1980s. It needs a fresh election</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It began on December 7th when Pedro Castillo, then the president of Peru, abruptly announced on television that he was ordering the dissolution of Congress and a takeover of the judiciary. Congress impeached him for breaking the constitution and appointed Dina Boluarte in his stead. Two months of mayhem have followed in which dozens have died, many seemingly killed by the security forces. Protesters have blocked scores of roads, especially in the Ades. They have launched violent attacks on five airports. Numerous courthouses, prosecutors’ offices and police stations have been vandalized. The economic damage will take yeas to repair. What explains all this fury? Mr Castillo, rural schoolteacher and trade union leader of indigenous descent and no political experience, was narrowly elected in 2021 and misgoverned woefully. But a third of the country sympathize with him and his claim that the right and the Congress prevented him from governing. Many more abhor the Congress, whose members seem more interested in looking after themselves than in legislating for the general good. However, the protests are fuelled by more than spontaneous popular anger. Far-left groups, illegal miners and drug traffickers are orchestrating them so as to force through the Constituent Assembly, which will help win themselves absolute power…</p>
<p><strong>Asian chipmakers | Silicon islands in the storm</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>America’s hoped-for Asian semiconductor pact faces steep odds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TSMC’s arrival in Kumamoto is one sign of boarder shifts in the semiconductor business across Asia. President Joe Biden’s administration has called for a “Chip 4 alliance” of America, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to co-ordinate chip policy in the hopes of reshaping supply chains. Yet America’s allies in Asia are all pursuing their own self-interested chip strategies, which are just as often in tension with each other as they are symbiotic. The semiconductor industry is no stranger to geopolitical wrestling. And Countries developed distinct chipmaking strengths. These days, America specialized in design while Taiwan dominates production of the high-end logic chips. South Korea focuses on memory chips. Japan has niches in optical sensors and the materials and kit needed to make semiconductors. China, which has poured money into its own chipmaking industry, has made most progress in lower-end logic chips.  America has offered big subsidies to its domestic chip industry. South Korea has passed support measures for its industry. Similar dynamics are in play in Taiwan. Japan has also loosen its purse-strings. The vision of a “democratic semiconductor supply chain” is not implausible. But creating chip networks rather than fueling chip wars will require careful co-ordination within individual governments, between allied governments and across public and private sectors. None of the countries’ bureaucrats are well-equipped to handle the complexity of semiconductor supply chains. And America’s unilateral attacks on China have made it harder to foster a spirit of co-operation. In part, Asian chipmakers worry about losing market share in China. Other risks like a supply glut induced by parallel industrial policies and insufficiency of engineers also abound.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence | Battle of the labs</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the AI race heats up, ChatGPT is not the only game in town</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every so often a technology captures the world’s imagination. The latest example, judging by the chatter in Silicon Valley, on Wall Street, in corner offices, newsrooms and classrooms around the world, is ChatGPT. In five days after its unveiling in November the artificially intelligent chatbot, created by a start-up called OpenAI, drew 1m users. Microsoft, which has just invested $10bn in OpenAI, wants ChatGPT-like powers to infuse much of the software it sells. Some search giants reportedly plans to add a chatbot to their search engines. It is too early to say how much of the early hype is justified, however, rival labs — be they part of big tech firms, affiliated with them or run by independent start-ups — are engaged in an epic race for AI supremacy. Big corporations are not the only game in town. Start-ups such as Anthropic and Character AI have built their own ChatGPT challengers. Stability AI, a start-up that has a consortium of small firms, universities and non-profits to pool computing resources, has created a popular open-source model. But almost all recent breakthroughs in big AI globally have come from giant companies. Experts opinion varies on who is actually ahead on the merits. When it comes to the sort of AI that is all the rage thanks to ChatGPT, though, the big battle is between Microsoft and Alphabet. Comparing the AI models created by these two firms, neither emerged as clearly superior. The reason why, at least so far, no model enjoys an unassailable advantage is that AI knowledge diffuses quickly. Researchers from competing labs move between organizations, bringing expertise and experience with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Habitat loss and climate change increase the risk of new diseases</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although scientists have not determined how covid-19 emerged, the leading theory is zoonotic spillover (transmission from animals). A recent study in Nature on bats finds that the risk of such spillovers is rising — though changes in human activity could return it to safer levels. The authors focus on the Hendra virus, which is excreted by bats and infects horses, then spread it to humans. The paper studied Hendra spillovers from fruit bats in subtropical eastern Australia, which have risen since 2006. It found that habitat loss combined with climate-induced food storages explained the increase. Bats, the only flying mammal, are potent vectors for zoonosis. Another paper in 2022 found that global warming, by forcing animals to change habitats, is expected to double the rate of first encounters (and thus potential viral spread) between mammals species. The impact of habitat loss appears reversible. The paper on Australia found that when eucalyptus trees (the bats live on their nectar) bloomed again, bats flocked back.</p>

<p>The trip ends by the water, the bright sun <strong>glinting</strong> off a <strong>*spanking</strong>-new* green-hydrogen plant.</p>
<p>On its own, each of these concerns is <strong>valid</strong>. But in terms of policy….</p>
<p>The infrastructure Act makes $1.2trn available over ten years for roads, bridges and cables for a new green grid.</p>
<p>With it comes <em>a <strong>plethora</strong> of</em> rules, from requirements that batteries be made in North America, to restrictions on tech imports and exports <em>on grounds of</em> national security.</p>
<p>And if other Western countries lose vital industries to America as they chase subsidies or <strong>duck</strong> import restrictions, then the alliances that <strong>underpin</strong> America’s security will suffer as a result.</p>
<p>Unemployment is at 3.5%, a 50-year low. More immigration could help fill vacancies, but it is restricted.</p>
<p>Its universities and venture capital make it a hub for green innovation.</p>
<p>And the policy enjoys a degree of <em>political consensus</em>.</p>
<p>One way to build a bloc <em>in favour of</em> a cheaper green transition would be to give foreign-made goods access to American subsidies.</p>
<p>Subsidies should <em>tilt towards</em> technologies that are not yet commercially viable, such as nuclear reactor and carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>Public money spent reshoring the manufacturing of solar panels that could be produced more cheaply elsewhere will be wasted.</p>
<p>But be under no illusions, it is <strong>audacious</strong> to believe that the way to cope with three problems which are too hard to tackle separately is to deal with them all at once.</p>

<p>Japanese semiconductor firms generate 20-30% of their business there, and <em>stand to lose</em> about 70% of it as a result of America’s curbs.</p>
<p>Japan recalls a painful Chinese ban on exports of rare-earth metals occasioned by a <strong>row</strong> over the disputed Senkaku / Diaoyu islands in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>Of executives surveyed by KPMG, a consultancy, 65% thought the supply shortage that <strong>hit</strong> some chips recently would ease in 2023.</p>
<p>Many also fret that America’s <em>curbs on China’s ambitions</em> for <em>high-end</em> chips will only mean China focusing its resources on <strong>*legacy</strong> chips<em>. Its successes in flooding the market to **</em>corner<em>* the production</em> of solar panels and rare earths are troubling precedents.</p>

</ul>
<p>Although scientists have not determined how covid-19 emerged, the leading theory is zoonotic spillover (transmission from animals).</p>
<p>This is also <strong>excreted</strong> by bats and infects horses, which spread it to humans.</p>
<p>It found that habitat loss combined with climate-induced food storages explained the increase.</p>
<p>This leads bats to form smaller <strong>roosts</strong> and eat inferior food, weakening them and probably causing them to excrete more <strong>pathogens</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of hunting for <strong>nectar</strong>, bats now spend long periods in roosts near humans.</p>
<p>When <strong>eucalyptus</strong> trees bloomed again, bats flocked back.</p>
