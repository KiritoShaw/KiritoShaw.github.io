<blockquote>
<p>The decarbonize faster, let renewables firms make money</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amid the misery war in Ukraine and the global energy crisis, there is a glimmer of good news. The green transition has speeded up. True, a spike in natural-gas prices fueled greater demand for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuels. But it also led consumers to use energy more efficiently. And, more significantly, it spurred investment in renewables around the world. As a happy consequences, the green transition may have accelerated by five to ten years. Yet the remarkable thing is that the transition could have proceeded at a faster pace still. Even as the governments have loosen purse-strings, they have begun to blunt the incentives to invest. One problem is obtaining permits. Endless delays stop firms that want to invest from breaking ground. (Denmark stopped processing all applications for projects like offshore wind, after a dawning realization that it may be in breach of EU law.) The gains from cutting red tape are large. The bigger problem is that some renewables providers are now rethinking their investments altogether, because energy projects are becoming less attractive as price caps and various taxes (windfall tax), together with rising costs, are pulling them off. Bloated costs, pushed up by post-lockdown rebounds and war-induced disruptions, would be manageable if they could be passed on. But the governments are increasingly micromanaging power markers to keep prices low, or to raise revenue of their own. The results has been squeezed profits. The four largest Western turbine-makers are losing money and some renewable generators are struggling to make money. This is clogging up project pipelines. Governments are keen to keep power prices low today, but that may be a false economy if it reduces the renewables spending needed for tomorrow. All this means that, if investing is to stay attractive, green power will need to be sold at higher prices than governments would like. If the energy transition is to happen fast, there must not be a race to the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Youth crime | Homeward bound</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the wake of violence, cities resort to ineffective youth curfews</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teenagers are forbidden by most youth-curfew laws from being public from midnight to dawn, with exceptions for work, school or emergencies. Curfew laws have long gone unenforced. But many cities are tightening their grip. Some shifts the 11pm curfew to 7pm. Fear of untamed teenagers made curfews popular. Youth crimes had risen as overall crime fell, and âwolf packâ of boys were to blame. By 2009, 84% of cities with more than 180,000 residents had enacted youth-curfew laws. However, there is little evidence that curfews curtail crime. They may even spur more of it. In 2015 economists found that stricter curfews in Washington, DC, led to more gunshots fired during curfews. With fewer people on the streets, crime flourished. And shutting teenagers in could pose dangers: rates of child abuse probably rose during covid-19 lockdowns, when families were confined to small places. Declaring curfews makes politicians look tough on crime. But implementing them is hard. Enforcement could distract police from more pressing matters, while also giving them a reason to arrest any youngster they choose. Atlantaâs city council is reviewing whether it is constitutional to keep children in after 8pm.  The fact that teenagersâ brain are not yet fully developed, a board member in an advocacy group  argues, is no reason to strip them of their right to walk to the grocery store after dinner. Despite clear cognitive declines in elderly people, law-makers do not restrict their movement. Some courts have stuck them down by emphasizing a childâs right to privacy or parentâs right to bring up their children as they see fit. The new proposal in Atlanta is unlikely to pass, but the cityâs 11pm curfew will probably remain in place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why southern Europe has fewer babies than the north</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Italyâs fertility rate (the average number of babies each Italian woman can expect to have) has dropped from 2.66 in 1964 to 1.24 in 2020. This makes Italy part of a band of ultra-low fertility across southern Europe, from Portugal and Spain (1.40 and 1.19) in the west to Greece and Cyprus (1.39 and 1.36) in the east. As 2.1 children per woman are needed to keep numbers stable, these countries must have more babies, admit more immigrants or see their populations dwindle. The budget for next year that the finance minister suggests, includes an increase in child benefits for the first child and for families with more than three children; a modest extension for maternity leave; reductions in the VAT on baby-care products; and changes in the pensionable age so that the more children a woman has, the earlier she will be able to retire. </p>
<p>In the worldview of the new right, feminism has given rise to generations of women who would rather work and play than raise children. But this narrative ignores two crucial facts. The first is that the most staunchly feminist countries, those in northern Europe, now have some of the continentâs highest birth rates. And the second is that women are often not opposed to having children; they are having fewer than they say they want, mostly for economic reasons. Globally, a fairly robust law has long linked national wealth and birth rates: as countries become richer, birth rates fall. But a group of researchers argue that among the richest nations the opposite now applies. As women enter the workforce, they increase economic output with labour and talent. They may also then vote for governments that spend money making it easier to be both a parent and a employee. Spending on family support also correlates positively with fertility. Generous paid maternity leave is one such policy; and the evidence that supports spending on child care is even stronger.</p>
<p>The gap in Spain between the number of children born (1.19 per woman) and the number desired (around two) is one of Europeâs highest. An economist looks for explanations wider than those directly related to family and says that boarder conditions â in particular the jobs market â play a critical role too. Spain lags behind in one crucial area: opportunities for the young. The youth unemployment rate is among the highest in the rich world, at around 35%, which led to widespread delay in marriage as well as childbirth. The late start to procreation may be a big factor in low overall fertility. But to fix that requires economic opportunities, which can take the form of a large number of stable jobs or take the form of dynamic job markets, where a job lost is reasonably likely to be replaced.</p>
<p>But what seems clear is that simply baby bribes â whether they come as one-time bonuses, monthly giveaways or tax credits â are not enough. The Poland government has run a generous monthly child benefit since 2016, but it has not seen an uptick in babies born. What young couples really want is job opportunities, support and choice. If all are available, more of them may use that choice to have more babies.</p>

<p>What Tencentâs rebound says about prospects for Chinaâs big tech</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps no company embodies the ups and downs of Chinese big tech better than its biggest tech firm of all â Tencent. Two years ago the online empire seemed unstoppable. Tencentâs market value exceeded $900bn, and the firm was on track to become Chinaâs first trillion-dollar company. Then Tencent was, along with the rest of Chinaâs once-thriving digital industry, caught up in a sweeping 18-month regulation, as the administration is  concerned about big techâs side-effects , from distracted teenagers to the diversion of capital from strategic sectors such as semiconductors. Regulators declared video games to be âspiritual opiumâ, and barred under-18s from playing more than three hours a week. These days things are looking up for Chinaâs internet companies. Shoppers are ârevenge spendingâ their way out of zero-covid. Regulators are easing off firmâs old business and giving them room to toy with new ones.</p>
<p>Tencent has no equivalent in the West, or anywhere else outside China. It is part Meta, part PayPal, part Epic Games (in which it owns a big stake), with a bit of Amazon and SoftBank thrown in (Tencent offers e-commerce and cloud services, like the American giant, and, like the Japanese one, has made hundreds of tech investments globally). The linchpin of Tencentâs riches is its WeChat super-app. Companies around the world have for years attempted to ape its astute marriage of pay (the transaction economy) and play (the attention economy). Few have succeeded in doing so as seamlessly as Tencent â and none on anything like the same scale. </p>
<p>Recent new-year blowout on WeChatâs newish Channels video platform hints at where Tencent is headed. And Tencent is eyeing a slug of that growth. Tencent is reorienting the âtransactionâ parts of the WeChat economy around Channels, too. Notably, it is equipping the platform for âsocial commerceâ. Tencent used to steer clear of this business, perhaps worried that its entry would hurt the value of its stake in JD.com. But the shift to Channels is crucial for Tencent. âThe hope of the companyâ, as the founder noted. The authoritiesâ anti-gaming stance makes it urgent to look elsewhere for growth. </p>
<p>Its recent success suggests this hope might not be forlorn. But to thriving in the new normal, where the government has put limits on some digital activities, and stands all too ready to place more, Tencent must deal with three challenges â as will Chinaâs other digital giants. The first of these has to do with ensuring a nimble company culture that can adjust to the new reality. Any foot-dragging could prove a problem, considering that tech firms will find themselves competing with each other more â the second challenge. The last thing that could trip up Tencent, or its rivals, is politics.</p>
<p>In China there is no room for digital winners â only survivors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new way to clean up the steel industry could cut emissions by more than 90%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making steel is dirty business. For every tonne of it some 1.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) are emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, steelmaking accounts for 7-9% of the worldâs anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions. Cleaner ways of producing steel are being explored. But much of the pertinent technology is in its infancy. Drs Ding and Kildahl of the University of Birmingham, have, however, come up with something they think might change things. They have developed a process which could be fitted quickly and cheaply to existing plants, and would cut their emissions by around 90%. They propose employing a closed-loop carbon-recycling systems to replace most of the coke. What makes all this possible is an intriguing material sharing the distinctive crystal structure of original perovskite called$\ BCNF_1$, other versions often used to make solar panels more efficient or produce phone screens that are almost unbreakable. This sits in a reaction chamber at the heart of the recycling system. For the trial plant to get under way, some hurdles will have to be overcome.</p>
<p>The point of replacing coke with hydrogen would have been to reduce the ore in a way that created water rather than$\ CO_2$, thus eliminating climate-warming emissions. But the infrastructure required to make, store and transport green hydrogen does not yet exist. And there are competing demands for the gas, including as a replacement for natural gas as a fuel for boilers, and in the production of green aviation fuel. So Dr Dingâs and Dr Kildahlâs proposal does look like a serious alternative. Give more work, it might be possible for$\ BCNF_1\ $to replace all of the coke in a blast furnace, cutting emissions down close to zero, reckons Dr Ding.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmology | Black holes and dark energy</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two of the universeâs most enigmatic phenomena may be intimately linked</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Black holes â objects so dense that nothing can escape their pull â are among the most eye-catching predictions of general relativity, a model of gravitational attraction proposed by Albert Einstein over a century ago. They squat invisibly in the middle of galaxies, feasting on stars and interstellar debris. However, they are also a clear indicator that general relativityâs days as gravityâs best explanation are numbered. That theory says a black holeâs core is a point of infinite density and pressure called a singularity, which is mathematically impossible. A host of more palatable alternatives have been proposed, but none has the observational evidence needed to back it up. Two new papers, co-written by Dr Pearson, are intended to change that. The paperâs authors scoured astronomical data for information about black holes at two stages of their lives. And they guesses that it is possible that black holes contain a well source of vacuum energy, instead of an infinitely dense singularity. âThisâ, says Dr Pearson, âis the first time thereâs been observational evidence that likes previous work to the real world.â More radical implications follow. The driving force of the accelerating expansion of the universe which began with the Big Bang, is labelled âdark energyâ, but no one knows what it actually is. In a daring theoretical leap, Dr Pearson and his colleagues suggest that the pockets of vacuum energy present in black holes could be responsible. The teamâs calculations show that the size and number of black holes in the universe would be enough to account for all the measured influence of dark energy. The neatness of this explanation is remarkable, but elegance is no proof of truth. Much more work is needed to discount other, albeit less spectacular, possibilities.</p>

<p>Victims are still being counted, but the earthquakes in Turkey on February 6th already rank as the worldâs deadliest natural disaster since 2010. Although any quake of such strength would inflict grave harm, flimsy houses exacerbated their impact. The scale of destruction is still being tallied. In the meantime, satellite images can yield estimates. Across nine urban areas 5% of buildings show signs of damage from space. In areas with cheap housing, the shares were greater. At our request Ollie Ballinger of University College London compared images of the region taken before the disaster with a satellite from fly-overs on February 9th and 10th. For each pixels, he calculated the odds that the change in signal intensity from the pre-quake baseline would arise by chance. We then combined these results with building maps from Microsoft and OpenStreetMap. We classified structures as possible damaged if any pixels had at least a 95% chance of true deviation from earlier images, and as probably damaged if a buildingâs average reached 95%. Current official figures show double-digit shares of buildings damaged in some cities, more than we could detect in most places. We also found that a 10% increase in average property prices was associated with a 0.8-percentage-point decline in the probable damage share. Living in the earthquake-prone region with lax building codes is risky. Doing so while poor is even riskier.</p>

<p>At the moment, coke and ore are packed in alternate layers inside a tower-Â­like <em>blast furnace</em> and, as the name implies, blasted with air that has been heated to more than 1,200Â°C. At this temperature the carbon in the coke reacts with the oxygen in the air to yield carbon monoxide (CO). This gas then goes on to react with the oxygen in the ore, liberating the iron in a process called reduction. Heat from the various reactions involved <em>pushes</em> the furnaceâs <em>temperature above</em> ironâs <em>melting point</em> (1,538Â°C), and the resulting liquid metal flows out of the bottom of the tower. Meanwhile, CO2 and other gases, including residual nitrogen from the injected air (which starts as 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen), are <strong>vented</strong> from the top.</p>
<p>The modification Drs Ding and Kildahl propose (see diagram on next page) cuts coke out of the loop by pumping CO directly into the blast furnace. The clever bit is where this gas comes from. It is made by capturing the CO2 produced in the furnace and recycling it by splitting it into CO and oxygen. The oxygen thus released can then be used in the second part of the steelmaking process, in which that gas is blown through molten iron in a differently designed furnace, to burn off part of the carbon now dissolved in it and arrive at the optimum ratio of iron to carbon to create the type of steel required.</p>
